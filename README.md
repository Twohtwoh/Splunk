# Splunk Module for Decisions (Tested against version 6.7)

This module will push selected log catagories directly to splunk as the logs are generated.

Once added to Decisions, in Splunk Settings under Settings, set the URL of the Splunk server (like https://localhost:8088/services/collector) and HEC Token value (like 61724a22-0b0b-4a50-9085-7d198471ba68), finally select which category of logs to send.
